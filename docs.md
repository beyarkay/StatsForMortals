# The Multivariate Normal Distribution
* Include something about solving d/d{exponential bit} to get the mean, but this is funky if you have rho!=0. When rho<>0, this gives you two equations and two unknowns which you can solve for. But the geometric interpretation is that the two equations you get, mu_x = something of mu_y and mu_y = something of mu_x give you the mean of the marginal distribution of that BVN, at a certain x or y value.
    * Question: are the two equations for mu_x, mu_y somehow related to the line that `y=rho*x` draws across the plot of the BVN?
* Instead of a full 3D plot, for now just get the MVP out:
    * 3 plots. first is a top-down color/contour plot of the BVN
    * Two others, each to show the marginal distributions. one to the right and one to the left.


# Ideas
3D
* Conditional Distros
* Bivariate Normal?
    * Either with a wiremesh, or with density dots

Covariance: 
* Treat covariance as a literal addition of loads of drawn out rectangles on a plot

Distros
* Gamma
    * Exponential
    * Chi-Squared
    * student's t and F?
Other
* Why Darth Vader's law?
* Sample stats (Distros for F_(1) and F_(n)?)
