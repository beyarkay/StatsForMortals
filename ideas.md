# Ideas

## Covariance: 
* Treat covariance as a literal addition of loads of drawn out rectangles on a plot
* https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18058/how-would-you-explain-covariance-to-someone-who-understands-only-the-mean/18200#18200

## Characteristic Function
And how it relates to the Fourier transform 

## Jacobian, determinants & change of variables
And how the determinant is really just the multiple of the change in the area of a linear 
transform

## Distros
* Gamma
    * Exponential
    * Chi-Squared
    * student's t and F?

##  Darth Vader's law?


## Sample stats (Distros for F_(1) and F_(n)?)
